// A number is left-heavy if the digits on the left side are larger than the digits on the right. 
// It is right-heavy if the digits on the right side are larger than the digits on the left. 
// Else, it is balanced.

// Write a function that takes in an integer and classifies it into one of the three 
// mutually exclusive categories: left, right or balanced. For inputs with an odd number 
// of integers, ignore the fulcrum (the middle number).
